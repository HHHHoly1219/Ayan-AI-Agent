# 🌏 AI Agent “Ayan” —— Intelligent Assistant for Chinese Teaching

This project is built on the **Coze platform**, developing and training an [**AI teaching assistant—“Ayan”**](https://www.coze.cn/store/agent/7478999081919103027?bot_id=true&bid=6hna5ul3g5009).  
It is designed to support teachers in international Chinese education (especially Confucius Institute volunteers and novice teachers) by addressing challenges such as insufficient teaching resources, low preparation efficiency, limited cross-cultural adaptability, and lack of classroom interaction.  

“Ayan” provides intelligent retrieval of teaching resources in pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and Chinese characters, while also supporting automatic lesson plan generation and classroom interaction design. It helps reduce teacher workload and improve teaching effectiveness.

## 📖 Background
In the context of international Chinese education, volunteer and novice teachers often face the following challenges:
- Insufficient teaching resources and low preparation efficiency  
- Limited classroom interactivity, making it difficult to engage students  
- Lack of experience in handling cross-cultural differences  
- Difficulty in providing personalized and differentiated teaching  

Traditional language knowledge repositories (covering pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and characters) offer basic support but lack **intelligence, interactivity, and integration**.  

Based on needs analysis and AI technology trends, this project introduces **the AI teaching assistant “Ayan”**, exploring how artificial intelligence can empower international Chinese education.
